I'll be using this site to track projects that I'm currently working on or have worked on in the past. I'm hoping it'll serve as a reasonable basecamp for showcasing my work, but we'll see how it goes. 
Here are some topics that interest me i.e. topics you can expect to see in future blog posts/projects:
- *Game programming*. I'm pretty into engine design and graphics programming at the moment. 
Largely because I'm working on my own engine (on top of SFML) for a game I'm working on. 
- *General programming and software design*. This is a recent interest for me -- I've started foraying from Python and Matlab into C++ lately, so this topic has become more relevant for me vis-a-vis game engine design. 
- *Deep learning* (along with the rest of the world). I do projects in this domain most semesters. 
Some past work has been on the following:
  - Deep learning in seismology.
  - Filtering toxic comments online using deep learning techniques.
  - Compressive sensing using deep learning.
  - Active subspaces in neural network architectures.
- *Mathematics*. Topics I'm generally interested in are optimization, statistics, probability theory, and linear algebra.

I've never been an avid blogger type, so this will be an interesting change of pace for me. 
I'm hoping I'll get some educational benefit out of the process -- having to explain topics intuitively and all that.
My goal isn't to write blog posts that just list equations and loosely tie them together with theorems; if I can't explain something intuitively, then I probably won't write about it.
That being said, my idea of intuitive and your idea of intuitive might not align in all cases -- I'll try to include some kind of trigger warning if I post something dense.
